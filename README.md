# Dermatologist-AI

In this mini project, you will design an algorithm that can visually diagnose melanoma, the deadliest form of skin cancer. In particular, your algorithm will distinguish this malignant skin tumor from two types of benign lesions (nevi and seborrheic keratoses).

The data and objective are pulled from the __2017 ISIC Challenge on Skin Lesion Analysis Towards Melanoma Detection__. As part of the challenge, participants were tasked to design an algorithm to diagnose skin lesion images as one of three different skin diseases (__melanoma__, __nevus__, or __seborrheic keratosis__). In this project, you will create a model to generate your own predictions.
